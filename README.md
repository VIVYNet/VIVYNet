# VIVYNet
Main Codebase for the entire project. Hosts all research progress for the creation of the text-to-music model

## Branches
Whenever you are working on a new task, subsection, or issue, please create a new branch respective to the task at hand. For example, you are working on fixing a bug in the decoder embeds. You would create a new branch called `Decoder Embed Fix #1` from the `Decoder Development` branch, and make changes under that branch. Once you are done with the fix and everything looks good, you would push your `Decoder Embed Fix #1` branch to the `Decoder Development` branch. 

The following are the general purposes of each branch:

`Development` - Houses all developed code from its children branches. May or may not be stable
